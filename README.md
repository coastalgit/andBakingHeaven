# Baking Recipes Project (Udacity Android Nanodegree)

## Project Overview

You will create an app, taking it from a functional state to a production-ready state. This will involve finding and handling error cases, adding accessibility features, allowing for localization, adding a widget, and adding a library.

## Why this Project?

As a working Android developer, you often have to create and implement apps where you are responsible for designing and planning the steps you need to take to create a production-ready app.

## What Will I Learn?

In this project you will:

- Use MediaPlayer/Exoplayer to display videos.
- Handle error cases in Android.
- Add a widget to your app experience.
- Leverage a third-party library in your app.
- Use Fragments to create a responsive design that works on phones and tablets.

## Requirements

Your task is to create a Android Baking App that will allow Udacityâ€™s resident baker-in-chief, Miriam, to share her recipes with the world. You will create an app that will allow a user to select a recipe and see video-guided steps for how to complete it.

One of the skills you will demonstrate in this project is how to handle unexpected input in your data -- professional developers often cannot expect polished JSON data when building an app.
